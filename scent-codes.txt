Scent Codes

Cyrano takes chips that contain five chambers each. The first chamber is usually unused, but the other four contain fragrance material. When it is time to play a scent, Cyrano rotates the chip so that one of the holes is "open" and releases scent. Each chip can only play one scent at a time (and because there are three chips, up to three smells can play at a time).
 
When using the SDK to play smells, the SDK is passed alphabetic scent codes. These scent codes correspond to slots in the chips.
